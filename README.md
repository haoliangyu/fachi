# fachi

**This whole thing is pretty much WIP.**

fachi is a modern benchmark framework for JavaScript and TypeScript code. It allows you to write and organize the benchmark code as general test files, which enables continuous benchmarking and monitoring in the CI/CD workflow. This provides an effective way to track the performance of your critical library and catch any accidental preformance degration.

A series of tools are included in the framework:

* @fachi/cli - A CLI tool to conviniently run bencharmk files and create the summary report
